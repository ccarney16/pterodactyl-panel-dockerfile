##
# Let's Encrypt Certbot
# This service provides free SSL certificates that can be used to connect to the world. 
# Uncomment if you are using the panel on its own (without a reverse proxy). It is 
# recommended to use the webroot plugin. To get a certificate, run "docker-compose 
# run --rm certbot --webroot -w /etc/letsencrypt/webroot -d {domain}" and follow
# the instructions on screen.

# If you plan on using another container for handling all the workers and cronjobs, 
# use these services and set DISABLE_WORKERS=true for the panel container
